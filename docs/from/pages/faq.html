<h2><a name="about-our-lamps">About Our Lamps</a></h2>

<h3>How can something that's plastic be handmade ?</h3>
<p>Our lamps aren't manufactured. Each one is made by a craftsperson using a technique quite similar to blowing glass. This ensures they're seamless so that no ugly joins are seen when they're switched on. It also means they can be made in quite small numbers so you'll get something that's pretty unusual.</p>

<h3>Are they safe to use as a children's night light ?</h3>
<p>Yes. Our current products are 12V Halogen bulbs from a mains transformer that plugs into the wall so the flex is all low voltage and completely safe. That said, this is a lamp containing a bulb so it shouldn't be viewed as a toy.</p>

<h3>Will the lamp survive an over curious dog ?</h3>
<p>Dogs do seem to love our lamps as well as humans. Fortunately they're very robust and more than able to survive canine curiosity.</p>

<h3>I've seen the Onion and Diego in other shops, how can they be original ?</h3>
<p>Onion and Diego are available through other stores but they're our designs. Currently we're working on some new designs and they will only be available through our site.</p>

<h2><a name="about-delivery">About Delivery</a></h2>

<h3>How do I know where my order is ?</h3>
<p>When we ship your item we'll send you an email along with a tracking number. You can use that number to track your parcel with our courier.</p>

<h3>Do we deliver internationally ?</h3>
<p>Yes we do. There is a charge for international delivery but we will include a convertor for your area so that you can plug the UK transformer socket into your plug.</p>

<h3>How do I contact you if I need help or advice ?</h3>
<p>We genuinely are a small design studio so we can't really afford a call centre but if you use the 'contact us' link at the top of the page then we certainly will respond. We haven't had an unhappy customer yet and we plan to keep it that way.</p>

<h3>What if I don't like my purchase ?</h3>
<p>Send it back to us within 30 days and we'll replace the item or refund your money, whatever works for you.</p>
